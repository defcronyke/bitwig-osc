# Bitwig OSC Python3
A Python3 client library for the Moss OSC Bitwig extension API.

Bitwig ( https://www.bitwig.com ) is a commercial multi-platform digital audio workstation or DAW. OSC or Open Sound Control ( http://opensoundcontrol.org/introduction-osc ) is a protocol for controlling DAWs and other things. Bitwig doesn't currently support OSC, but a community member has made a Bitwig extension which adds OSC support to Bitwig.

This library aims to provide a high-level abstraction for the Moss OSC Bitwig API, which can be used to control Bitwig with Python3.

Here is the current OSC API for Bitwig, it can do a lot!: https://github.com/git-moss/DrivenByMoss/wiki/Open-Sound-Control-(OSC)
